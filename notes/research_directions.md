# Research Directions & Open Questions

## Core Research Direction

Investigating how **dynamic role allocation** and **iterative feedback loops** in human-AI collaboration affect research task outcomes, compared to traditional static role assignments.

## Key Open Questions

### Theoretical Questions

1. **What triggers optimal role transitions?**
   - Task phase transitions?
   - Confidence level changes?
   - User engagement signals?
   - Explicit user requests?

2. **How do mental models develop in human-AI collaboration?**
   - Do humans develop accurate models of AI capabilities over time?
   - Does the AI's representation of user preferences improve?
   - What enables "transactive memory" in human-AI pairs?

3. **What are the boundaries of effective collaboration?**
   - At what task complexity does AI assistance become counterproductive?
   - When does accumulated context become stale or misleading?
   - How much role switching is too much?

### Methodological Questions

1. **How do we measure collaboration quality?**
   - Expert ratings are subjective - can we develop objective metrics?
   - Should we measure process or outcomes or both?
   - How do we account for individual differences?

2. **How do we control for confounds in longitudinal studies?**
   - Task familiarity vs. collaboration familiarity
   - Learning effects in within-subject designs
   - Participant motivation over time

3. **How generalizable are lab findings?**
   - Controlled tasks vs. real research
   - Graduate students vs. expert researchers
   - Specific AI models vs. general capabilities

### Design Questions

1. **How should role transitions be signaled?**
   - Explicit UI indicators?
   - Natural language cues from AI?
   - Implicit through behavior change?

2. **What context should be accumulated?**
   - Full interaction history? (Too much)
   - Summary only? (May lose nuance)
   - User preferences and patterns?
   - Task-specific knowledge?

3. **How should the AI express uncertainty?**
   - Numeric confidence scores?
   - Hedged language?
   - Explicit "I don't know"?
   - Asking for human input?

## Potential Extensions

### Short-term (Next 6 months)
- Complete Experiments 1 and 3
- Analyze interaction pattern data
- Develop preliminary design guidelines

### Medium-term (6-12 months)
- Field study with active researchers
- Extend to other research tasks (writing, analysis)
- Develop automated role transition detection

### Long-term (1-2 years)
- Build adaptive AI research assistant prototype
- Large-scale deployment study
- Contribute to AI interaction design standards
