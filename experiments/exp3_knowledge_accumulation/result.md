# Experiment 3: Results

## Status: NOT YET CONDUCTED

Pending completion of Experiment 1.

## Expected Sections

### Participant Flow
- Enrollment numbers
- Dropout and reasons
- Final sample by condition

### Primary Results: Learning Curves

#### Completion Time by Session and Condition

| Session | Fresh (M, SD) | Accumulated (M, SD) |
|---------|---------------|---------------------|
| 1 | - | - |
| 2 | - | - |
| 3 | - | - |
| 4 | - | - |
| 5 | - | - |

#### Mixed-Effects Model Results
- Session effect: β = X.XX, SE = X.XX, p = .XXX
- Condition effect: β = X.XX, SE = X.XX, p = .XXX
- Session × Condition: β = X.XX, SE = X.XX, p = .XXX

### Secondary Results

#### Trust Development
- Trust scores by session and condition
- Rate of trust increase comparison

#### Quality Trajectory
- Quality scores across sessions
- Condition differences

#### Interaction Patterns
- Words per exchange by session
- Reference to past context (accumulated only)

### Figures (To Be Generated)

1. Learning curves: Time by session, lines by condition
2. Trust development trajectories
3. Quality improvement curves
4. Context reference frequency

### Qualitative Findings

#### Interview Themes (Accumulated Condition)
- Value of remembered preferences
- Frustrations with context
- Suggestions for improvement

#### Interview Themes (Fresh Condition)
- Repetition burden
- Adaptation strategies
- Comparative perspective

## Discussion Points (To Be Addressed)

- Does accumulated context help? How much?
- What aspects of context are most valuable?
- Are there downsides to context accumulation?
- Design implications for persistent AI assistants
