# Experiment 1: Results

## Status: NOT YET CONDUCTED

This document will be populated with results after experiment execution.

## Expected Sections

### Participant Demographics
- Sample size and completion rate
- Background characteristics
- Prior AI experience distribution

### Primary Results

#### Quality Scores by Condition

| Condition | Mean (SD) | 95% CI |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Static AI Lead | - | - |
| Static Human Lead | - | - |
| Dynamic | - | - |

#### Statistical Tests
- ANOVA results: F(2, XX) = X.XX, p = .XXX, η² = .XX
- Pairwise comparisons (Tukey HSD)

### Secondary Results

#### Time to Completion
- Means and comparisons by condition

#### Cognitive Load (NASA-TLX)
- Profile across 6 dimensions
- MANOVA results

#### Satisfaction Ratings
- Mean scores by condition

### Exploratory Findings

#### Interaction Patterns
- Role transition frequency
- Turn length distribution
- Initiative ratio

#### Individual Differences
- Effect of prior AI experience
- Effect of topic familiarity

## Figures (To Be Generated)

1. Box plots: Quality by condition
2. Bar chart: Time by condition
3. Radar chart: NASA-TLX profile
4. Sankey diagram: Interaction patterns

## Discussion Points (To Be Addressed)

- Did dynamic allocation help? If so, why?
- Which task phases benefited most?
- What were common failure modes?
- Implications for AI assistant design
