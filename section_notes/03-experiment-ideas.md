# Experiment Ideas and Designs

## Overview

This document outlines specific experimental approaches to test our hypotheses about AI-human collaborative dynamics in research tasks. Each experiment is designed to provide empirical evidence for or against our theoretical predictions.

## Experiment 1: Dynamic Role Allocation Study

### Hypothesis Tested: H1
Dynamic role allocation systems will produce superior research outcomes compared to static role assignments.

### Experimental Design

**Participants**: 60 researchers (graduate students and postdocs) across STEM and social science disciplines

**Task**: Literature review and synthesis on assigned research topics (standardized complexity)

**Conditions**:
1. **Static Control**: Fixed roles - Human leads, AI assists with search and summarization
2. **Dynamic Treatment**: Adaptive allocation based on:
   - Task requirements (search vs synthesis vs critical analysis)
   - Real-time competency assessment
   - Participant expertise level
   - AI confidence scores

**Duration**: 4 weeks per participant (2 hours/week structured sessions)

**Measurements**:
- Research quality (expert evaluation using standardized rubric)
- Task completion efficiency (time to milestones)
- User satisfaction and perceived agency
- Knowledge retention (tested 1 week post-completion)
- Role transition frequency and triggers

**Analysis Plan**:
- Between-subjects ANOVA comparing conditions
- Regression analysis identifying optimal role allocation triggers
- Qualitative analysis of participant feedback on role transitions

### Expected Outcomes
Dynamic condition should show 15-20% improvement in research quality scores and higher user satisfaction, particularly for complex synthesis tasks.

## Experiment 2: Iterative vs Sequential Collaboration Patterns

### Hypothesis Tested: H2
Iterative feedback mechanisms will demonstrate higher research velocity and quality than sequential workflows.

### Experimental Design

**Participants**: 40 research teams (2 humans + AI agent each)

**Task**: Original research project from hypothesis generation to preliminary results

**Conditions**:
1. **Sequential**: Linear progression through phases (lit review → hypothesis → method → analysis)
2. **Iterative**: Structured cycles with feedback loops and refinement opportunities

**Duration**: 8 weeks with weekly check-ins

**Measurements**:
- Research velocity (milestones achieved per week)
- Hypothesis refinement quality (expert evaluation of evolution)
- Insight generation rate (novel connections identified)
- Final research quality (peer review simulation)
- Process satisfaction and perceived learning

**Analysis Plan**:
- Mixed-effects modeling accounting for team and time effects
- Time-series analysis of hypothesis evolution
- Network analysis of idea connections over time

### Expected Outcomes
Iterative condition should show higher research velocity and more sophisticated hypothesis development, with evidence of cumulative learning effects.

## Experiment 3: Shared Context Management Study

### Hypothesis Tested: H3
Persistent shared context will improve collaboration consistency and enable cumulative learning.

### Experimental Design

**Participants**: 50 individual researchers

**Task**: Multi-session research project (hypothesis development and testing)

**Conditions**:
1. **Context-Naive**: Each session starts fresh, minimal history
2. **Context-Aware**: Persistent memory of previous insights, hypotheses, and decisions
3. **Context-Active**: System actively surfaces relevant past context and connections

**Duration**: 6 weeks (3 sessions per week, 1 hour each)

**Measurements**:
- Context utilization rate (references to previous work)
- Cumulative learning indicators (building on previous insights)
- Consistency across sessions (coherent research narrative)
- Session efficiency (reduced re-explanation time)
- Long-term knowledge retention

**Analysis Plan**:
- Longitudinal growth curve modeling
- Content analysis of cross-session references
- Efficiency trends over time

### Expected Outcomes
Context-active condition should show strongest cumulative learning effects and highest consistency, with context-aware outperforming context-naive.

## Experiment 4: Metacognitive Collaboration Protocol Study

### Hypothesis Tested: H4
Explicit metacognitive strategies will improve coordination and reduce friction.

### Experimental Design

**Participants**: 45 researchers randomly assigned to conditions

**Task**: Complex research problem-solving (systematic review with novel synthesis)

**Conditions**:
1. **Standard**: Normal collaboration without explicit process reflection
2. **Self-Metacognitive**: Participants explicitly reflect on their own process
3. **Collaborative-Metacognitive**: Both human and AI engage in joint process reflection and optimization

**Duration**: 5 weeks with structured reflection sessions

**Measurements**:
- Coordination efficiency (successful handoffs, minimal rework)
- Friction incidents (conflicts, misunderstandings, inefficiencies)
- Collaborative satisfaction (relationship quality measures)
- Process awareness (ability to describe collaboration patterns)
- Adaptation effectiveness (improvement in coordination over time)

**Analysis Plan**:
- Event analysis of friction incidents
- Process mining to identify coordination patterns
- Longitudinal analysis of satisfaction and efficiency trends

### Expected Outcomes
Collaborative-metacognitive condition should show lowest friction and highest satisfaction, with evidence of adaptive improvement over time.

## Experiment 5: Task-Specific Collaboration Optimization

### Hypothesis Tested: H5
Task-specific collaboration patterns will outperform general-purpose frameworks.

### Experimental Design

**Participants**: 80 researchers (20 per task type)

**Tasks**: Four distinct research activities:
1. **Literature Review**: Systematic search, analysis, and synthesis
2. **Hypothesis Generation**: Creative ideation and theoretical development
3. **Experiment Design**: Method development and protocol creation
4. **Data Analysis**: Statistical analysis and interpretation

**Conditions** (within each task):
1. **General**: One-size-fits-all collaboration protocol
2. **Task-Optimized**: Collaboration pattern designed specifically for the task type

**Duration**: 3 weeks per task

**Measurements**:
- Task-specific performance metrics (quality rubrics for each task type)
- User preference and satisfaction ratings
- Efficiency measures (time to completion, iterations required)
- Adaptation effectiveness (how well users adapt to specialized vs general protocols)

**Analysis Plan**:
- Mixed-effects ANOVA with task type and condition factors
- User preference analysis across task types
- Performance prediction modeling based on task characteristics

### Expected Outcomes
Task-optimized conditions should consistently outperform general conditions, with effect sizes varying by task complexity and structure.
