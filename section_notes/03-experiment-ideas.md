# Experiment Ideas

## Experiment 1: Collaboration Structure Comparison

### Research Question
Does dynamic role allocation outperform static role allocation in research literature review tasks?

### Design
- **Independent Variable**: Collaboration structure (static vs. dynamic)
- **Dependent Variables**:
  - Review quality (expert rating)
  - Time to completion
  - Coverage of relevant literature
  - Participant cognitive load (NASA-TLX)

### Conditions
1. **Static-AI-Lead**: AI generates summaries, human reviews
2. **Static-Human-Lead**: Human directs, AI executes queries
3. **Dynamic**: Role shifts based on task phase and confidence

### Participants
- 30 graduate students (within-subject design)
- Counter-balanced order

### Task
- Literature review on a novel topic (15 papers)
- 90-minute time limit per condition

### Metrics
- Quality: Expert panel rating (1-5 scale)
- Efficiency: Time to completion
- Coverage: % of key papers identified
- Load: NASA-TLX scores

## Experiment 2: Feedback Loop Depth Study

### Research Question
What is the optimal number of feedback iterations for research writing tasks?

### Design
- **Independent Variable**: Number of feedback iterations (1, 2, 3, 5, unlimited)
- **Dependent Variables**:
  - Writing quality
  - Writer satisfaction
  - Time investment

### Task
- Write a 500-word research summary
- AI provides feedback after each draft

### Hypothesis
Quality improvements plateau after 3 iterations, but satisfaction may differ.

## Experiment 3: Knowledge Accumulation Over Time

### Research Question
How does collaboration effectiveness change over multiple sessions?

### Design
- **Longitudinal study**: 5 sessions over 2 weeks
- **Measure**: Task performance, collaboration patterns, trust levels

### Conditions
1. **Fresh context**: Each session starts without memory
2. **Accumulated context**: AI retains previous session information

### Hypothesis
Accumulated context leads to faster improvement in collaboration efficiency.

## Experiment 4: Role Transition Triggers

### Research Question
What factors should trigger role transitions in human-AI collaboration?

### Design
- **Observational study**: Analyze successful collaborations
- **Identify**: Natural transition points and triggers

### Data Collection
- Screen recordings
- Think-aloud protocols
- Interaction logs

### Analysis
- Thematic coding of transition moments
- Quantitative analysis of transition correlates
